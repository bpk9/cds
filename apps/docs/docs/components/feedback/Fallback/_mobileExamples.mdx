### Basic example

```jsx
<VStack gap={1}>
  <Fallback width={150} height={45} />
  <Fallback width={65} height={45} percentage />
</VStack>
```

### Shape

The shape of the fallback can further be customized with the `shape` prop.

```jsx
<HStack gap={1}>
  <Fallback width={50} height={50} shape="square" />
  <Fallback width={50} height={50} shape="squircle" />
  <Fallback width={50} height={50} shape="circle" />
</HStack>
```

:::tip Rectangular fallback width

If the fallback shape is a rectangle and the width is specified as a number, then by default, the width value will be recalculated and randomized within a predetermined threshold (e.g. to add some variety when mulitple fallbacks are presented together). If this behavior is undesirable (e.g. in server-side rendered web apps), randomization can be disabled with the `disableRandomRectWidth` prop.

<br />

Alternatively, you may create a rectangle width variant by setting a number value on the `rectWidthVariant` prop. Variants map to a predetermined set of width values, which are cycled through repeatedly when the set is exhausted. Therefore, it's still possible to achieve some variety, but in a deterministic manner (i.e. safe for server-side rendering). Here's an example:

<br />

```jsx
function RenderFallbacksInList() {
  const items = [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}];
  return (
    <VStack gap={1}>
      {items.map((_, i) => (
        <Fallback width={150} rectWidthVariant={i} />
      ))}
    </VStack>
  );
}
```
