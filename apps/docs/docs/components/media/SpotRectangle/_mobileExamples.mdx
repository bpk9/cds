### Basic example

```jsx
<SpotRectangle name="creditCardExcitement" />
```

### `scaleMultiplier` prop

If no predefined dimensions fit your use case, you can use the `scaleMultiplier` prop to scale the illustration.

Use `scaleMultiplier` sparingly and with caution. We have predefined dimensions to ensure that illustrations scale elegantly.

```jsx
<SpotRectangle name="creditCardExcitement" scaleMultiplier={1.5} />
```

### Scaling with dimension

If `dimension` and `scaleMultiplier` are both provided the component will scale based on the provided dimension.

```jsx
<SpotRectangle name="creditCardExcitement" dimension="240x120" scaleMultiplier={1.5} />
```
