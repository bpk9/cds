Interactable components are simple elements that define background and border styles, both of which are used in determining state styles.

### Hover and pressed states

These states are rather complex as they are _not_ a simple color hexcode. Instead, we dynamically blend the background/foreground color with a chosen spectrum color, coupled with an opacity change, to determine the new state color.

On mobile, stacked `View`s are used to achieve this.

On web, combining `background-image`, `background-color`, and CSS variables are used to achieve this.

```jsx
<Interactable
  background="bgAlternate"
  borderColor="fgPositive"
  borderWidth="button"
  borderRadius={300}
>
  <Box as="span" padding={1}>
    <Text font="headline" as="span">
      Content goes here!
    </Text>
  </Box>
</Interactable>
```

### Disabled states

On both platforms, interactable elements have their opacity greatly reduced when disabled.

```jsx
<Interactable
  disabled
  background="bgAlternate"
  borderColor="fgNegative"
  borderWidth="button"
  borderRadius={500}
>
  <Box as="span" padding={1}>
    <Text font="headline" as="span">
      Content goes here!
    </Text>
  </Box>
</Interactable>
```

### Block Interactable

Interactables expand to 100% width when the `block` prop is passed.

```jsx
<Interactable
  block
  background="bgAlternate"
  borderColor="fgNegative"
  borderWidth="button"
  borderRadius={500}
>
  <Box as="span" padding={1}>
    <Text font="headline" as="span">
      Content goes here!
    </Text>
  </Box>
</Interactable>
```

### A11y

Since this component is low-level, it doesn't require much accessibility out of the box. Instead, accessibility should be applied when composing _with_ interactable. An example of this can be found in the [Pressable](/components/inputs/Pressable) component.
