:::tip
For React Native projects, ensure you have set up your environment for React Native development. Refer to the [React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) if needed.

### 1. Render a ThemeProvider

Render a ThemeProvider at the root of your application, and pass the `theme` and `activeColorScheme`.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@coinbase/cds-mobile';
import { defaultTheme } from '@coinbase/cds-mobile/themes/defaultTheme';
import App from './App';

const Index = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme} activeColorScheme="light">
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);

export default Index;
```
