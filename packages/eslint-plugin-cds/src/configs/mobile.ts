/**
 * For mobile codebases, our plugin includes react-native-a11y rules.

 * Note: We list react-native-a11y as a plugin. This makes the plugin's rules available to be turned on or off in the configuration.
 * It's a more selective approach that requires you to manually specify which rules to enable.
 * (As opposed to extending which is used to inherit configurations from a set of predefined rules.)
