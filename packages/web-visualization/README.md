# @coinbase/cds-web-visualization

@coinbase/cds-web-visualization is a domain set of components that we have identified as web visualization components. They were moved from cds-web in an effort to decompose our core package and make it more reliable. The decomposition of our core packages (cds-web and cds-web) is an ongoing effort that should be continued over time, see [Design System Package Decomposition](../../docs/package-decomposition.md) for more information.
