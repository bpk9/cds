<!-- 4. TODO: add a step to check deployment status -->

5. After the deploy has succeeded, verify that the new package was published at the [production Coinbase NPM registry](https://npmjs.com/package/@coinbase/ui/repos/tree/General/cb-npm-master). It usually takes about 10 min or so for the package to be uploaded. Look for the version number at the bottom of the artifact list in the [package directory](https://npmjs.com/package/@coinbase/ui/repos/tree/General/cb-npm-master/@coinbase/ui-mobile-visreg/-/@coinbase/ui-mobile-visreg-1.0.0-rc.1.tgz).
