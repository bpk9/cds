# AI Guidelines

This section outlines guidelines for AI code assistants to follow.

## General Principles

- Follow project standards: always follow the Coding Standards and all established coding standards and practices present in the code
- Minimize unnecessary changes: avoid stylistic or trivial modifications that are unrelated to the task at hand. Do not reformat code, adjust whitespace or quotes, or rename variables unless those changes are a part of a deliberate improvement
- No unnecessary confirmations: don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context
- Single chunk edits: provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file
- Explain significant changes: when performing a complex refactor or introducing a non-obvious solution, explain why the changes were made

## Code Reviews

When asked to review a component, check for the following

- Structure: does the component's file follow the correct structure of imports, styles, types, and component?
- Type safety: were any changes made backwards compatible? Were there any breaking changes? Are props clearly typed and following best practices? Are there any props that are unused / missing?
- Styling: does the component rely on css variables and theme tokens where possible? Are there any missing className or styles props?
- Accessibility: does the component follow best practices for accessibility for the platform?
- Tests & stories: is the component used in a meaningful way by Jest tests and have story examples?

## Use of References

- Link to real files: when referring to existing code, provide a link to the actual file
- Leverage examples: if unsure about an implementation, look for similar examples in the codebase. It's preferable to follow established patterns in CDS rather than introducing new ones

## Tests

Whenever you make changes, you should run the specific test files or test the entire package you have modified

- To run tests by package, run `yarn nx run [package]:[script]`, such as `yarn nx run mobile:test`
  - Supports test, build, link, and typecheck as scripts
- You can also run specific files or tests via `--testPathPattern` and `--testNamePattern` props
  - For example, running `yarn nx run mobile:test --testPathPattern=IconButton.test.tsx` would test IconButton in mobile
